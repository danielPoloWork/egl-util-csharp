# Changelog

All notable changes to `egl-util-csharp` are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Every PR that introduces a user-visible change adds a line to `[Unreleased]` in the same
PR. A release PR moves the `[Unreleased]` entries into a new per-version file under
`docs/changelog/v<MAJOR>/v<X.Y.Z>.md` and adds an index row below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation i18n & README polish (Milestone 9): the README translated into Simplified Chinese
  (`docs/i18n/zh/README.md`) and Japanese (`docs/i18n/jp/README.md`), with a `docs/i18n/` index and a content-digest
  freshness manifest (English remains the source of truth; ADR-0011); plus an enterprise README refresh
  — a NuGet version/downloads/CI/.NET/License badge row, a quick-start, and a translations switcher. The
  `i18n-freshness` lint is now content-digest based (squash-merge-safe). Docs only — the shipped package
  is unchanged.
